# 365Admincognito

This project provides a simple one-click button on the Chrome taskbar that launches an incognito window directing you to log in at admin.microsoft.com.

That's it. That's the whole project.

Put it in a folder, set Chrome/Brave to developer mode, and install the plugin. You may need to manually pin it to the extensions area.
